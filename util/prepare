# Run this pre-build stages
# format should run before lint, because we want issues in sources that are possible to autofix to be fixed right away
# generation should run after format, because we want issues in generated code to be picked up by lint, so we can fix the template
# lint should run last, because we want to report only issues that could not be fixed in format and also issues with generated code
