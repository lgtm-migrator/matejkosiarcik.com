<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
  My name is Matej Košiarčik.

  I am an aspiring software developer in my mid 20s living in Slovakia (Europe), near capital city of Bratislava.
  <br>
  My current focus is finishing my masters degree of Software engineering in Bratislava (ETA june 2022).

  I have professional experience with mobile apps, web frontends and QA testing & automation.
