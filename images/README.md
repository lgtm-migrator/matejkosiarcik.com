# Images

> This folder contains images (original and optimized).

<!-- toc -->

- [Development](#development)

<!-- tocstop -->

Even though the optimized images are just a build artifact,
they are stored in project anyway, because generating them takes a long time
(and so does not make sense to wait an hour on each CI build).

## Development

```sh
make build
```
